Debouncing: 


typing slow = 200ms
typing fast = 30ms


Perfomance: 
 - iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000  = 140000
 - with debouncing= 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000



 Debouncing with 200ms
 - if difference between 2 key strokes is <200ms - DECLINE API call
- >200ms make an API call






Cache: 
time complexity tro search in array = O(n)
time complexity tro search in Object = O(1)
